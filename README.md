This programme was created by Richard Brown to support pupils in Special Educational Needs (SEN) education. 
Its main purpose is to give children and young people a stronger pupil voice during Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) and annual review meetings.

By using this tool, pupils can share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a way that is accessible and meaningful to them. 
It aims to make their input clearer, ensure their views are heard, and help them take an active role in decisions about their education and support.
